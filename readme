I had a dream that I wanted to write a program in GoLang
that would take all the chapters of a book and combine them
so that I could read the book all at once instead of chapters
by chapter. This code his the hysterical result of that fever 
dream. 

As a plus I am trying to learn Golang so this gave me a good
opportunity to practice loading filestream!
